Summary for Project 2.

Using Microsoft Azure this website will evaluate the text for likability. We designed this with the thought of creating a more politically correct world (because the world isnt politically correct enough already!).

Using Heroku:

1. Type in the following url address 

2. From the home page enter in your text into the text field. 

3. The website will return a score from 0-100. the lower the score the lower the likability of your text. 

4. The website will also return a pie chart to reflect how the text could be perceived.




Installing and using from a private server:

1. Clone the repo into a private file.

2. If you do not have node installed you will need to install nodejs. 

3. Using your terminal navigate into the Project2 file. 

4. In the terminal run "npm install" to install all node packages. 

5. To run the server type "node server.js.

6. From the terminal use the following url localhost:3000.

7. From the home page enter in your text into the text field. 

8. The website will return a score from 0-100. the lower the score the lower the likability of your text.
